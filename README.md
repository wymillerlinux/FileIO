For CIT 255 - Messing with some files

Basically, I created three different serializers for CSV, XML and JSON files.
Okay, I lied, I really didn't create a serializer for XML and JSON files, but we put front-end logic to it. I just used some libraries.

This project is using the N-Tier architecture. 

If would like to know more about this coding exercise, here is my [email](mailto:wjmiller2016@gmail.com).
